title: Write Engineering Investment Cases, Not Technical Proposals

The difference between senior and staff-level engineering leaders often comes down to one skill: the ability to translate technical work into business investment cases.

Most engineering managers are good at writing technical proposals. They explain what needs to be built, how it will be architected, and why it's technically sound. But these proposals often die in prioritization meetings because they fail to answer the question executives actually care about: "Why should we invest here instead of somewhere else?"

## The Investment Case Framework

An engineering investment case treats every significant technical initiative as a business investment with expected returns. Here's the structure:

**1. The Problem in Business Terms**
Don't say: "Our API response times are degrading."
Say: "Slow checkout is costing us $2M annually in abandoned carts."

**2. The Investment Required**
- Engineering time (in team-weeks, not story points)
- Opportunity cost (what we won't build)
- Risk capital (what happens if we're wrong)

**3. Expected Returns**
Quantify at least one of these:
- Revenue impact: "Unlocks $5M in enterprise deals blocked by compliance gaps"
- Cost savings: "Reduces infrastructure spend by 40%, saving $800K/year"
- Risk reduction: "Prevents estimated $10M security breach scenario"
- Velocity multiplier: "Reduces deployment time from 2 hours to 10 minutes, enabling 3x more iterations"

**4. Time to Value**
- When do we start seeing returns?
- What's the payback period?
- What are the incremental milestones?

**5. Alternative Options Considered**
Show you've thought about:
- Do nothing (what's the cost of inaction?)
- Buy vs. build
- Smaller incremental approaches

## Why This Works

This framework forces you to:
- **Think from the business backward**: You start with impact, not implementation
- **Make trade-offs explicit**: Every "yes" to your proposal is a "no" to something else
- **Build credibility**: You demonstrate you understand the business, not just the technology
- **Create accountability**: You've defined success metrics upfront

## Start Small

You don't need to transform every ticket into an investment case. Start with:
- Any initiative requiring more than 4 engineer-weeks
- Technical debt that you're struggling to prioritize
- Platform investments without obvious product features
- Architectural changes that seem "obvious" to engineers but unclear to stakeholders

## The Long-Term Leverage

Over time, this discipline compounds:
- Your team learns to think in terms of business value
- Product and business leaders trust engineering estimates
- You get more autonomy because you've proven you optimize for business outcomes
- Technical excellence becomes funded because you've shown it drives results

The best engineering managers don't fight for engineering resources—they articulate why engineering investments generate returns that compound over time.

Start with your next technical proposal. Before you share it, rewrite it as an investment case. The discipline of articulating business value will transform how you lead.
