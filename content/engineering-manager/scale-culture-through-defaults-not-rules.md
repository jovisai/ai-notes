title: Scale Culture Through Defaults, Not Rules

Most engineering managers try to scale culture through policies, rules, and guidelines. They write extensive playbooks, create approval processes, and implement governance frameworks. But as teams grow, this approach becomes a bottleneck. You become the referee, constantly interpreting rules and making exceptions.

**The high-leverage alternative: Design powerful defaults instead of rigid rules.**

## The Power of Defaults

Defaults are the "path of least resistance" behaviors built into your systems, tools, and workflows. They're what happens when people don't actively choose otherwise. Defaults scale culture because they:

- Require no enforcement or policing
- Work 24/7 across all time zones
- Get stronger as the team grows (network effects)
- Free you from being the decision bottleneck

## From Rules to Defaults: Practical Examples

**Instead of:** "All PRs must be reviewed within 24 hours"
**Create the default:** Set up Slack notifications for PRs open >12 hours. Make PR review count visible on team dashboards. Block your own calendar time for reviews.

**Instead of:** "Developers must write tests"
**Create the default:** Make CI fail without tests. Set up test scaffolding generators. Make untested code harder to merge than tested code.

**Instead of:** "Use our coding standards"
**Create the default:** Auto-format on save. Pre-commit hooks that enforce style. IDE templates that generate compliant code.

**Instead of:** "Align with stakeholders before building"
**Create the default:** Require a design doc template with stakeholder sign-off fields. Make Jira tickets incomplete without them.

## How to Build Powerful Defaults

1. **Identify your highest-value behaviors** - What do your best performers do naturally that you wish everyone did?

2. **Make the right thing the easy thing** - Reduce friction for desired behaviors. Add friction for undesired ones.

3. **Build it into the infrastructure** - Tools, templates, automation, and workflows carry culture better than words.

4. **Start small and iterate** - One powerful default is worth ten mediocre rules.

## The Mindset Shift

Stop asking: "How do I get people to do X?"
Start asking: "How do I make X the natural path?"

Your job isn't to enforce standards—it's to architect an environment where the right behaviors emerge naturally. This is how you scale yourself and your impact as your organization grows.

The best engineering cultures aren't managed. They're designed.
