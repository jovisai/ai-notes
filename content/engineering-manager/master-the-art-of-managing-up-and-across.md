The highest-leverage skill most engineering managers neglect isn't managing their team—it's managing up to leadership and across to peer managers. Your ability to influence without authority, shape organizational priorities, and create alignment beyond your team determines whether you remain a team-level manager or become a true organizational leader.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

Your team's impact is constrained by organizational context. You can have the best engineers, the cleanest architecture, and the fastest delivery—but if leadership doesn't understand your team's value, if peer teams create friction, or if you're working on the wrong priorities, none of it matters.

**Managing up and across is how you shape the environment your team operates in.**

## Managing Up: Become a Strategic Partner, Not a Status Reporter

Most EMs treat communication with their director or VP as status updates. They report what happened. Elite EMs use that time to shape what *will* happen.

### The Shift

**From**: "Here's what we shipped last sprint"
**To**: "Here's what we learned that should change our strategy"

### Tactical Actions

1. **Lead with insights, not updates**: Your boss can read Jira. What they can't do is synthesize ground-level information into strategic implications. When you meet, lead with: "Based on what we're seeing, I think we should reconsider X because Y."

2. **Proactively surface trade-offs**: Don't wait to be asked "Can we do this faster?" Present options: "We can ship in 4 weeks with reduced scope, 6 weeks with full scope, or 3 weeks if we deprioritize project Y. Here's my recommendation and why."

3. **Make their job easier**: Understand what your boss is accountable for. What keeps them up at night? What metrics are they measured on? Align your communication to show how your team's work connects to their success.

4. **Build trust through predictability**: Be the manager whose estimates are reliable, whose risks are surfaced early, and whose surprises are rare. Trust is the compound interest of leadership credibility.

## Managing Across: Build Alliances Before You Need Them

Cross-functional effectiveness is where most technical organizations break down. Dependencies turn into blockers, misalignment creates rework, and peer teams become adversaries instead of allies.

### The Shift

**From**: Transactional coordination when you need something
**To**: Ongoing relationship investment that creates organizational capacity

### Tactical Actions

1. **Schedule recurring syncs with key peer EMs**: Even 30 minutes monthly with peer managers from product, platform, or dependent teams creates alignment that prevents weeks of coordination overhead later.

2. **Share context generously**: When you learn something that might affect another team, tell them before they ask. This creates reciprocity and positions you as a trusted partner rather than a competitor for resources.

3. **Take on cross-team problems**: Volunteer to lead initiatives that span multiple teams. These are the problems no one owns, and solving them gives you visibility, builds relationships, and demonstrates organizational leadership.

4. **Advocate for peer teams**: When resource allocation discussions happen, don't just fight for your team. Demonstrate organizational thinking by acknowledging trade-offs: "My team could use that engineer, but honestly, the platform team's work would unblock three teams, including mine."

## The Compound Effect

When you master managing up and across:
- Your team gets prioritized for resources because leadership understands your strategic value
- Cross-team projects move faster because relationships pre-exist the need
- You hear about organizational changes early, giving you time to adapt
- Your opinion is sought on decisions beyond your team's scope

## Start This Week

1. **Audit your calendar**: How much time do you spend managing up and across vs. managing down? If it's less than 20%, you're under-investing.

2. **Schedule one coffee chat**: Reach out to a peer EM you don't know well. Learn their priorities and pain points. No agenda except relationship building.

3. **Reframe your next leadership update**: Instead of a status report, prepare one strategic insight from your team's work and one recommendation for organizational action.

Your team's ceiling is defined by your organizational influence. The best engineering managers don't just build great teams—they build the organizational conditions for great teams to thrive.
