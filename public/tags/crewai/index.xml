      <description>&lt;p&gt;CrewAI and LangGraph are two of the most popular frameworks for building multi-agent AI systems. But they take fundamentally different approaches. CrewAI uses a role-based metaphor where agents are team members with defined roles. LangGraph uses a graph-based approach where you define states and transitions explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll build the same workflow in both frameworks: a research assistant that finds information and writes a summary. This will reveal the practical differences between the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. It allows you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems that can collaborate to solve complex problems. This guide breaks down CrewAI into 10 fundamental concepts, taking you from first principles to building a complete, end-to-end agentic workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;concept-1-the-agent&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept 1: The Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental Idea:&lt;/strong&gt; An Agent is an autonomous entity designed to perform specific roles, achieve goals, and execute tasks. Think of it as a specialized member of your AI team. Each agent has a unique role, a goal that defines its purpose, and a backstory that provides context and personality. This allows agents to behave in a more specialized and predictable way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
