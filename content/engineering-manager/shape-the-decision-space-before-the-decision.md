The most impactful engineering managers don't make great decisions—they ensure great decisions get made without them.

## The Insight

Most managers focus on being present for important decisions. Senior EMs focus on shaping the environment where decisions happen. By the time a decision reaches you, you've already lost leverage. Your highest-impact work happens upstream: defining constraints, establishing criteria, and creating the context that makes the right choice obvious.

## Why This Matters

As you scale beyond one team, you physically cannot be in every room where decisions happen. If your organization needs you present to make good calls, you've created a bottleneck that will cap your impact. The goal is to build an organization that makes decisions you'd be proud of—even when you're not there.

## How to Apply This

### 1. Define Decision Frameworks, Not Answers

Instead of: "Let me review that architecture proposal"
Try: "Here are the three questions every architecture proposal must answer: What's the blast radius? What's the migration path? How does this compound our capabilities?"

Share these frameworks widely. When engineers internalize the questions, they'll arrive at sound answers themselves.

### 2. Pre-commit to Trade-off Criteria

Before projects start, make explicit: "We'll prioritize time-to-market over polish for this quarter" or "Data integrity trumps feature velocity for this domain." When teams know the hierarchy of values, they can resolve conflicts autonomously.

### 3. Create Decision Records for Precedent

Document not just *what* was decided but *why* and *under what conditions* it would be revisited. This transforms individual decisions into organizational knowledge. Future teams can pattern-match against past reasoning rather than re-litigating from scratch.

### 4. Design Review Rituals, Not Gates

Replace approval workflows with structured peer reviews. Your role shifts from gatekeeper to ritual designer. Define what good critique looks like, who should be in the room, and what questions get asked—then step out.

## The Litmus Test

Ask yourself: "If I disappeared for two weeks, what decisions would stall?" That's your backlog of decision frameworks to create.

## Start Tomorrow

Pick one recurring decision type where you're currently a bottleneck. Write a one-page guide covering: the key trade-offs, the criteria for choosing, and two examples of past decisions with reasoning. Share it with your team and explicitly delegate those decisions going forward.

Your leverage as an EM isn't measured by the quality of decisions you make—it's measured by the quality of decisions that happen when you're not in the room.
