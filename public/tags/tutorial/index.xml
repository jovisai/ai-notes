      <description>Problem Overview We&amp;rsquo;ll build a sophisticated rate limiting service that supports:&#xA;Multiple rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket, Fixed Window, Sliding Window) Different storage backends (Memory, Redis) Per-user and per-API-key limits Rate limit headers in responses Graceful degradation when storage fails This is complex enough to demonstrate TDD&amp;rsquo;s power with AI agents.&#xA;Why TDD Works Exceptionally Well with AI Agents The AI Agent Advantage:&#xA;Perfect Memory: Never forgets edge cases once written in tests Pattern Recognition: Excellent at implementing algorithms to match test specifications Systematic Approach: Follows TDD discipline consistently Rapid Iteration: Fast feedback cycles between test and implementation The Key Insight: AI agents excel when they have clear specifications (tests) rather than vague requirements.</description>

      <description>One of the most exciting architectural innovations in recent years is the Mixture of Experts (MoE). It&amp;rsquo;s a key reason why models like Mistral&amp;rsquo;s Mixtral and (reportedly) OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-4 are so powerful.&#xA;To really understand MoE, let’s go back to first principles. Here’s a rewritten version of your article with a Flesch Reading Ease score above 70. The language is simpler and more direct, while keeping the core ideas intact.</description>

      <description>CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. It allows you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems that can collaborate to solve complex problems. This guide breaks down CrewAI into 10 fundamental concepts, taking you from first principles to building a complete, end-to-end agentic workflow.&#xA;Concept 1: The Agent Fundamental Idea: An Agent is an autonomous entity designed to perform specific roles, achieve goals, and execute tasks. Think of it as a specialized member of your AI team.</description>
