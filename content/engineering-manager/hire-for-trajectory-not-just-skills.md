Most engineering managers hire for what candidates can do today. Great engineering managers hire for where candidates will be in 18 months.

## The Trajectory Principle

When you're building a high-performing team, the single most predictive factor of success isn't the depth of current technical skills—it's the **rate of learning and growth trajectory**. A senior engineer who's plateaued will add less long-term value than a mid-level engineer with exponential growth potential.

## Why This Matters at Scale

As you scale teams, hiring for today's needs creates tomorrow's bottlenecks. You end up with:
- Teams that can't adapt to changing technical landscapes
- Knowledge silos where only certain people can work on certain problems
- Limited bench strength for future leadership roles
- Constant need to hire externally for new capabilities

When you hire for trajectory, you build:
- Self-upgrading teams that evolve with your tech stack
- Internal promotion pipelines that retain top talent
- Organizational resilience and adaptability
- Compound growth in team capability

## How to Identify High-Trajectory Candidates

**Look for learning velocity signals:**

1. **Polyglot experience**: Have they picked up multiple languages/frameworks quickly? Breadth signals learning ability.

2. **Context switching**: Did they move between domains (frontend → backend → infrastructure)? Adaptability is trajectory.

3. **Self-directed growth**: Do they learn outside work? Side projects, open source, deep dives into problems they didn't have to solve—these reveal intrinsic drive.

4. **Recent acceleration**: What have they learned in the last 6-12 months? Recent growth predicts future growth.

5. **Problem sophistication arc**: How has the complexity of problems they've solved evolved over time? Flat means plateau.

**Interview for trajectory:**
- "Tell me about a technology you learned recently. Walk me through how you approached learning it."
- "Describe a time you were completely out of your depth. What did you do?"
- "What's something you believe about software engineering today that you didn't believe two years ago?"

## The Actionable Shift

**This week:** Review your interview rubric. Add explicit criteria for learning ability and growth trajectory alongside technical skills. Weight them equally.

**This month:** In your next hire, identify one candidate who might be "underleveled" on paper but shows exceptional growth signals. Make the case to hire them.

**This quarter:** Track promotion and impact velocity for trajectory hires vs. traditional hires. Use this data to build confidence in the approach.

## The Strategic Payoff

Trajectory hiring transforms your hiring pipeline from a tactical gap-filler into a strategic capability builder. You're not just solving today's problems—you're building the team that will solve problems you can't even see yet.

The best engineering managers don't just fill seats. They identify and amplify human potential. That's how you build organizations that compound in capability over time.

**Remember:** Skills depreciate. Learning ability appreciates. Hire accordingly.
