title: Invest in Compounding Leverage

The difference between good engineering managers and exceptional ones isn't how much they do—it's how much compounds over time.

## The Concept

Most managers think linearly: hire more people to do more work. But exceptional managers think exponentially: they invest time in things that create compounding returns. Every hour spent on high-leverage activities should make the next hundred hours more productive.

## What Compounds

**1. Documentation that teaches**
Write the explanation once. Your team reads it forever. Better yet: they update it, making it stronger. One hour invested can save hundreds of hours of repeated questions.

**2. Tools that automate**
Build internal tooling that removes friction. A script that automates environment setup saves 2 hours per engineer, per quarter. With a team of 20, that's 160 hours annually—from one day of work.

**3. Standards that scale decisions**
Don't decide the same question repeatedly. Create a coding standard, an API design principle, or a deployment checklist. Now those decisions happen automatically, correctly, at scale.

**4. People who teach others**
Invest in developing engineers who can mentor. One senior engineer teaching five juniors creates geometric growth in capability. You've multiplied your technical leadership by 5x.

**5. Processes that improve themselves**
Design retrospectives that actually change how you work. Build feedback loops into your systems. The process gets better each cycle, without additional input from you.

## The Trap to Avoid

Don't confuse "urgent" with "compounding." That production bug feels critical, but fixing it yourself is linear leverage—it solves one problem, once. Teaching an engineer to debug production issues? That's exponential.

## Your Action Plan

This week, audit where you spend your time. Ask of each task:

- **Linear question:** "Does this solve today's problem?"
- **Exponential question:** "Will this make similar problems easier to solve in the future?"

Shift 20% of your time from linear to exponential work. In six months, you'll notice your team solving problems you haven't even seen yet. In a year, you'll wonder how you ever managed any other way.

## The Compound Effect

The magic happens when these stack. Documentation enables people to self-serve. Self-sufficient people can build better tools. Better tools free time for teaching. Teaching creates more people who document, build, and teach.

That's when you stop being a bottleneck and become a force multiplier.

**Start today:** Pick one thing you did this week that you'll probably do again. How can you turn it into something that compounds?
