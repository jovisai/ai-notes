Most engineering managers focus on growing mid-level engineers. The real leverage? Building a systematic pipeline for Staff-Plus engineers.

## Why This Matters

Organizations scale through technical leadership, not just more hands. One Staff engineer who can influence 20 engineers creates more impact than hiring 5 more seniors. Yet most managers treat Staff-Plus growth as random chance—waiting for someone to "emerge" rather than deliberately developing this capability.

## The Anti-Pattern

You have strong senior engineers who:
- Excel at execution but avoid ambiguity
- Deliver projects but don't shape direction
- Solve problems but don't prevent them
- Work in their domain but don't cross boundaries

They stay "almost Staff" for years because there's no clear path from execution excellence to strategic impact.

## The Leverage Point

**Create explicit Staff-Plus apprenticeships, not vague "stretch opportunities."**

Here's the framework:

### 1. **Define the Capability Gaps**

Staff-Plus engineers operate differently than seniors:
- **Scope expansion**: From "solve this problem" to "identify the right problems"
- **Influence model**: From "write good code" to "shape how 50 engineers write code"
- **Timeline shift**: From quarterly delivery to multi-year technical strategy
- **Ambiguity tolerance**: From clear requirements to figuring out what to build

Don't guess what someone needs—audit their actual gaps against these dimensions.

### 2. **Design Scaffolded Ownership**

Give candidates controlled Staff-Plus problems with safety nets:

- **Quarter 1**: Co-own a cross-team initiative with you as backup
- **Quarter 2**: Lead a technical standard that affects 3 teams (you review, don't drive)
- **Quarter 3**: Drive architecture for the next 6-month roadmap (you coach, don't correct)
- **Quarter 4**: Own a business-critical technical decision with exec visibility

The goal isn't perfection—it's building the muscle for operating at scope.

### 3. **Make the Invisible Work Visible**

Staff-Plus work is often invisible. Your job is to spotlight it:

- When they prevent a problem before it happens—broadcast it
- When they influence through design docs instead of code—measure it
- When they mentor other engineers to multiply impact—quantify it

Create a "Staff-Plus highlights" artifact you share monthly with senior leadership. This does two things: builds their visibility and teaches them what Staff-Plus impact looks like.

### 4. **Run Calibration Sessions**

Most managers calibrate on promotions. Run calibration sessions on **Staff-Plus development**:

- Quarterly: Review all Staff-Plus candidates with peer managers
- Compare: "What does great look like at this stage?"
- Identify: Where are patterns across candidates? (Common gaps = systemic training opportunity)
- Adjust: Are we creating the right apprenticeships?

This prevents the "they're not ready yet" loop that keeps strong engineers stuck.

## Start Today

Pick one senior engineer this week and:

1. **Audit their gaps**: Which Staff-Plus capability is most underdeveloped?
2. **Design one apprenticeship**: What controlled Staff-Plus problem could they own in Q1?
3. **Create visibility**: What artifact will make their Staff-Plus work visible to leadership?

Staff-Plus engineering is not a promotion tier—it's a capability you systematically develop. Build the pipeline, not the waiting room.
