1. What is an AI Maturity Model? An AI Maturity Model is a structured diagnostic and planning tool that scores an organization’s readiness to adopt, scale and govern AI across people, process, data, technology and ethics dimensions.
The most widely-used frameworks define five maturity levels:
Level Typical Label One-line Description 1 Limited Sporadic experiments, no formal ownership 2 Reactive Ad-hoc pilots triggered by external hype 3 Developing Systematic pilots, basic governance 4 Embedded AI is part of standard workflows 5 Best-in-class / AI-native Self-improving AI systems and culture 2. Why run an AI maturity assessment? Baseline – “Where are we today?” Gap &amp; Risk Radar – Spot under-funded or high-risk areas (e.g., data quality, ethics). Shared Language – Replace “We need more AI” with “We need Level-3 Data Governance before we scale to Level-4 AutoML”. Investment Logic – Tie budget requests to quantified maturity gaps. OKR &amp; Strategy Input – Convert gaps into quarterly OKRs the whole org can rally around. 3. How to run the assessment (step-by-step) Phase Key Actions Tips &amp; Artefacts 1. Set Context All-hands meeting &#43; FAQ memo explaining why the model matters. Address job-impact &amp; ethics fears up-front. 2. Show the Model Share a one-page maturity grid (see example below). Use a cross-functional working group as model owners. 3. Score Self-assessment survey &#43; workshop validation. 1–5 Likert scale, evidence required for each score. 4. Visualize Heat-map summarizing strengths &amp; red zones. Hustle Badger canvas or simple Excel radar chart. 5. Commit Publish the heat-map and assign executive owners. Re-score each OKR cycle to track progress.

<h2 id="7-final-thoughts">7. Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>An AI Maturity Model is most powerful when it stops being a consultant’s slide and becomes a <strong>living management routine</strong>.<br>
By baking maturity gaps into OKRs, organizations create a virtuous loop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assess → Prioritize → Execute → Re-assess → Learn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do this every quarter and AI stops being a side project; it becomes how you run the business.</p>
