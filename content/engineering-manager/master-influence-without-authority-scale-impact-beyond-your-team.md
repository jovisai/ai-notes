As an engineering manager, your biggest leverage opportunities often lie outside your direct reporting chain. The ability to influence without authority is what separates managers who scale linearly with team size from those who scale exponentially with organizational impact.

## The Authority Trap

Most new engineering managers rely heavily on their positional authority—it works within their team, but fails spectacularly everywhere else. You can't command the product team to prioritize technical debt, mandate the infrastructure team to adopt your standards, or order other engineering teams to integrate with your API.

Yet these cross-functional and cross-team relationships determine whether your team delivers incremental features or transformational impact.

## The Core Principle: Make Others Successful

The fundamental shift is this: **influence comes from making other people successful at achieving their goals, not from getting them to support yours.**

Instead of asking "How do I get Product to prioritize our refactor?" ask "What problems is Product trying to solve, and how can our technical work accelerate their success?"

## Three High-Leverage Practices

### 1. Build Trust Through Small Deposits

Don't wait until you need something to start building relationships. Make regular "trust deposits":

- Share early insights that help other teams avoid problems
- Offer your team's expertise for their challenges (even 30 minutes of pairing)
- Create visibility into your work that makes their lives easier
- Credit their contributions publicly and specifically

When you need to influence a decision later, you're drawing on a trust account you've been building for months.

### 2. Speak Their Language, Not Yours

Technical excellence doesn't persuade non-technical stakeholders. Translate everything into their success metrics:

- **Product:** User impact, feature velocity, time-to-market
- **Business:** Revenue, cost, risk mitigation, competitive advantage
- **Other Engineering Teams:** Reduced operational burden, reusability, faster debugging

If you're explaining your API redesign, don't lead with "better abstractions." Lead with "this cuts integration time from 2 weeks to 2 days, meaning Product can ship features 5x faster."

### 3. Create Shared Wins

Structure initiatives so success for you means success for them:

- Propose joint metrics where both teams benefit from the outcome
- Frame technical investments as enabling their roadmap, not blocking it
- Build solutions that solve their immediate pain while creating long-term leverage
- Invite them into the design process early—co-creation beats buy-in

## The Practical Implementation

This week, identify one cross-functional relationship where you need more influence:

1. **Map their goals:** What are they measured on? What keeps them up at night?
2. **Find the overlap:** Where does their success intersect with your technical vision?
3. **Make a trust deposit:** Do something valuable for them with no immediate ask
4. **Speak their language:** Reframe your next proposal in terms of their metrics
5. **Create a shared win:** Structure your next initiative so both teams succeed together

## Why This Matters

As you grow as an engineering leader, your impact increasingly depends on people you don't manage. Staff engineers need to influence architecture decisions across teams. Directors need to align multiple engineering organizations. VPs need to shape company-wide technical strategy.

Mastering influence without authority isn't just a useful skill—it's the fundamental mechanism for scaling your impact beyond the limits of your headcount and org chart.

The best engineering managers don't just build great teams. They build networks of influence that multiply their team's impact across the entire organization.
