Artificial Intelligence is moving beyond conversational chatbots to become *autonomous research agents*. Unlike conventional LLM assistants that answer questions based on pre-trained knowledge, these new systems—collectively called **Deep Research AI**—can:

* Plan and execute multi-step investigations
* Formulate sub-questions and hypotheses
* Browse the web and databases iteratively
* Evaluate sources and compile structured reports with citations

This process, while slower, achieves comprehensive, verifiable insights comparable to a PhD-level literature review.


## **How Deep Research Works**

**Core Stages:**

1. **Planning:** Breaks the main query into a structured research plan.
2. **Agentic Search:** Iteratively refines queries and gathers data across sources.
3. **Analysis and Synthesis:** Compares, contextualizes, and integrates information.
4. **Reporting:** Produces structured documents with citations.
