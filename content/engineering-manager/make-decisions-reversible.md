One of the highest-leverage skills you can develop as an engineering manager is **designing your decisions to be reversible**.

Most managers waste enormous amounts of time trying to make "perfect" decisions on questions that don't require perfection. They over-research, over-debate, and create analysis paralysis in their teams.

The secret: **categorize every decision as either one-way or two-way doors**.

## One-way doors vs Two-way doors

**One-way doors** are hard or impossible to reverse. Examples:
- Choosing your core database technology
- Hiring or firing decisions
- Committing to a major customer contract
- Selecting your primary programming language

These deserve careful analysis, broad input, and slow deliberation.

**Two-way doors** are easily reversible. Examples:
- Team meeting schedules
- Documentation formats
- Most process changes
- Initial service architecture choices (with proper abstractions)

These should be decided quickly with 70% of the information you'd like to have.

## The Practice

Before making any decision, ask: **"How hard would it be to reverse this?"**

If it's reversible:
1. Make the call quickly
2. Set a review date (1-3 months out)
3. Document what success looks like
4. Move forward with conviction
5. Adjust based on data, not opinions

If it's irreversible:
1. Slow down appropriately
2. Gather diverse perspectives
3. Think second-order effects
4. Make the decision, then commit fully

## Why This Works

This approach gives you:
- **Speed**: Your team moves 3-5x faster on 80% of decisions
- **Learning**: You gather real-world data instead of theoretical debates
- **Culture**: You model bias-to-action and data-driven iteration
- **Energy**: You save cognitive resources for decisions that truly matter

The best engineering organizations aren't those that make perfect decisions. They're the ones that make good-enough decisions quickly, learn from them rapidly, and course-correct effectively.

Start today: identify one decision you're overthinking. If it's a two-way door, make the call by end of day.
