      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building AI agents is one thing. Knowing if they actually work is another. Traditional software testing doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply—you can&amp;rsquo;t assert that an LLM response equals an exact string. You need metrics that capture semantic correctness, relevance, and faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DeepEval is an open-source framework specifically designed for evaluating LLM applications. It provides metrics for RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and chatbots. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through evaluating a real AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the relentless pursuit of robust and secure software, developers have long relied on a combination of automated testing, manual quality assurance, and periodic security audits. But what if we could create a system that continuously and autonomously hardens software from the inside out? Inspired by military red team/blue team exercises and advancements in multi-agent AI, we can design a self-improving ecosystem where AI agents work adversarially to find and fix flaws before they ever reach production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
