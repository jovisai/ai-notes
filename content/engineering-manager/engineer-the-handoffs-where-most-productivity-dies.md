title: "Engineer the Handoffs Where Most Productivity Dies"

Most engineering managers optimize for individual productivity. They focus on hiring great people, improving code quality, and eliminating blockers. But the real productivity killer lurks in the spaces *between* people, teams, and systems.

**Handoffs are where most work goes to die.**

Every time work passes from one person to another, from one team to another, or from one system to another, you pay a tax. Context is lost. Work sits idle in queues. Misunderstandings multiply. That three-day feature becomes a three-week saga—not because the coding took longer, but because it spent 12 days waiting, being clarified, and being re-explained.

## The Hidden Cost of Handoffs

Think about your last major feature. How much time was spent:
- Waiting for design specs?
- Clarifying requirements across teams?
- Coordinating deployments with platform teams?
- Re-explaining context to different stakeholders?
- Fixing integration issues between components owned by different teams?

These aren't anomalies. They're the system working as designed. And most organizations tolerate them as "the cost of doing business."

Great engineering managers don't tolerate them. They **engineer the handoffs**.

## How to Engineer Better Handoffs

### 1. Make Handoffs Visible
You can't optimize what you don't measure. Map your team's dependencies and handoff points explicitly:
- What work requires input from other teams?
- Where does work typically queue or stall?
- What context is consistently lost in translation?

Track handoff time separately from work time. You'll be shocked how much of your cycle time is just *waiting*.

### 2. Reduce Handoff Surface Area
The best handoff is the one that never happens. Can you:
- **Embed specialists** within teams instead of creating specialist silos?
- **Give teams end-to-end ownership** instead of splitting features across org boundaries?
- **Build internal platforms with self-service** instead of requiring tickets and approvals?

Every handoff you eliminate doubles the productivity of everyone involved.

### 3. Standardize the Handoffs You Can't Eliminate
For unavoidable handoffs, reduce the friction:
- **Create templates** for common requests (e.g., infrastructure provisioning, design reviews)
- **Define service level expectations** so teams know when to expect responses
- **Automate status updates** so people aren't playing tag over Slack
- **Document context once** in a shared source of truth instead of re-explaining over and over

### 4. Design for Asynchronous Handoffs
Real-time coordination is expensive and doesn't scale. Design handoffs to work asynchronously:
- Write comprehensive specs that answer the questions before they're asked
- Record video walkthroughs instead of scheduling meetings
- Use structured documents instead of scattered Slack threads
- Build observability into your systems so teams can debug without asking

### 5. Build Overlap and Shared Context
The best teams have deliberate overlap in their knowledge and responsibilities. This creates redundancy that protects against handoff failures:
- Rotate engineers through different areas
- Have team members shadow each other
- Share architecture review sessions across teams
- Create shared on-call rotations for cross-team systems

## Start Today

Pick one critical handoff in your organization. Maybe it's between product and engineering, or between two engineering teams. Measure it. Map it. Then ask:

**"How can we make this handoff 10x faster, or eliminate it entirely?"**

That single improvement will unlock more productivity than any individual optimization you could make. Because in modern software organizations, the bottleneck isn't the work—it's the space between the work.

**The highest-leverage move you can make as an EM isn't hiring faster, coding better, or planning smarter. It's engineering the connective tissue that makes your organization actually function.**
