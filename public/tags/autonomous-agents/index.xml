      <title>TDD with Coding Agents: Building a Rate Limiting Service</title>

      <description>Problem Overview We&amp;rsquo;ll build a sophisticated rate limiting service that supports:&#xA;Multiple rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket, Fixed Window, Sliding Window) Different storage backends (Memory, Redis) Per-user and per-API-key limits Rate limit headers in responses Graceful degradation when storage fails This is complex enough to demonstrate TDD&amp;rsquo;s power with AI agents.&#xA;Why TDD Works Exceptionally Well with AI Agents The AI Agent Advantage:&#xA;Perfect Memory: Never forgets edge cases once written in tests Pattern Recognition: Excellent at implementing algorithms to match test specifications Systematic Approach: Follows TDD discipline consistently Rapid Iteration: Fast feedback cycles between test and implementation The Key Insight: AI agents excel when they have clear specifications (tests) rather than vague requirements.</description>

      <description>Imagine a coding partner that doesn’t just write software, but iteratively evolves it, learns from its mistakes, and even discovers brand-new algorithms some better than anything a human has ever designed.&#xA;Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, it’s exactly what AlphaEvolve, a new breakthrough from DeepMind, is all about.&#xA;So, What Exactly is AlphaEvolve? At its heart, AlphaEvolve is an AI agent that’s been built to do one thing: discover new and better code through evolution.</description>

      <description>CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. It allows you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems that can collaborate to solve complex problems. This guide breaks down CrewAI into 10 fundamental concepts, taking you from first principles to building a complete, end-to-end agentic workflow.&#xA;Concept 1: The Agent Fundamental Idea: An Agent is an autonomous entity designed to perform specific roles, achieve goals, and execute tasks. Think of it as a specialized member of your AI team.</description>

      <title>A Developer&#39;s Guide to Effective AI Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://notes.muthu.co/2025/07/a-developers-guide-to-effective-ai-coding-agents/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 11:00:00 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://notes.muthu.co/2025/07/a-developers-guide-to-effective-ai-coding-agents/</guid>
      <description>AI-powered coding assistants are rapidly evolving from simple auto-completion tools into sophisticated, collaborative agents. While it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to offload entire tasks to these systems, the most effective approach is a guided one, where the developer remains the architect and the AI acts as a highly efficient executor.&#xA;This guide outlines a structured workflow for leveraging AI coding agents, ensuring you maintain control, improve code quality, and boost your productivity.&#xA;The Developer as Architect The fundamental principle of effective AI collaboration is that the developer must lead the process.</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence is moving beyond conversational chatbots to become autonomous research agents. Unlike conventional LLM assistants that answer questions based on pre-trained knowledge, these new systems—collectively called Deep Research AI—can:&#xA;Plan and execute multi-step investigations Formulate sub-questions and hypotheses Browse the web and databases iteratively Evaluate sources and compile structured reports with citations This process, while slower, achieves comprehensive, verifiable insights comparable to a PhD-level literature review.&#xA;How Deep Research Works Core Stages:</description>
