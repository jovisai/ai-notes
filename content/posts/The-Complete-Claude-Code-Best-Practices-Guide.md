## Introduction

Claude Code represents a paradigm shift in software development - it's not just a coding assistant, but a general-purpose AI agent that happens to excel at code. This guide consolidates insights from Anthropic's internal teams, community developers, and real-world production usage to help you master Claude Code.

### Key Principles
- **Think of Claude as a very fast intern with perfect memory but limited experience**
- **Be specific in your instructions - Claude can't read your mind**
- **Use iterative workflows - the first attempt is rarely the final solution**
- **Leverage Claude's strengths: pattern recognition, documentation, and systematic problem-solving**

---

## Quick Start & Setup

### Installation & Authentication

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npx @anthropics/claude

# Navigate to your project and start Claude
cd your-project
npx @anthropics/claude
```

### Essential First Steps
1. **Run `/init` command** in any existing project to generate CLAUDE.md
2. **Set up permissions** with `/permissions` for tools you trust
3. **Install GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for GitHub integration
4. **Configure your shell** with `/terminal-setup` for better UX

## Configuration Mastery

### CLAUDE.md Files - Your AI's Memory

CLAUDE.md is Claude's persistent memory. Think of it as onboarding documentation for a new team member.

#### Location Priority
1. **Current directory**: `CLAUDE.md` (shared) or `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored)
2. **Parent directories**: For monorepos
3. **Child directories**: Pulled on-demand
4. **Global**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (applies to all sessions)

#### Essential CLAUDE.md Structure
```markdown
# Project: [Project Name]

## Quick Commands
- `npm run build`: Build the project
- `npm run test`: Run tests
- `npm run lint`: Run linting
- `npm run typecheck`: Type checking

## Code Style & Standards
- Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS
- Destructure imports when possible
- Always run tests after code changes
- Prefer single test files over full suites for performance
- Use TypeScript strict mode

## Architecture & Key Files
- Core logic: `src/services/main_service.py`
- API routes: `src/api/routes/`
- Database models: `src/models/`
- Tests: `tests/` (mirrors src structure)

## Workflow Rules
- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Always create feature branches from `develop`
- Run linter before commits
- Write tests for new functionality

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Never uncomment test blocks without explicit instruction
- Reuse existing DAO functions instead of creating redundant ones
- Check existing patterns before implementing new solutions
- IMPORTANT: Always validate input parameters for API endpoints
- YOU MUST: Run type checking after making changes
```

#### Advanced CLAUDE.md Techniques
- **Use examples**: Include ✅ good and ❌ bad code examples
- **Tune for effectiveness**: Run files through prompt improvers
- **Add emphasis**: Use "IMPORTANT" or "YOU MUST" for critical rules
- **Keep it updated**: Use `#` key during sessions to add new rules
- **Import other files**: Use `@docs/api_conventions.md` for modularity

### Permission Management

#### Strategic Permission Setup
```bash
# Allow safe operations
/permissions add Edit
/permissions add "Bash(git commit:*)"
/permissions add "Bash(git push:*)"

# Allow specific MCP tools
/permissions add mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate
```

#### Team Permissions
Share permissions via `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Edit",
    "Bash(git commit:*)",
    "mcp__github__*"
  ]
}
```

---

## Core Workflows & Patterns

### 1. The Explore → Plan → Code → Commit Pattern

This is the most versatile and effective workflow:

```markdown
**Phase 1: Explore**
"Read the authentication module and related test files. Don't write any code yet - just explore and understand the current implementation."

**Phase 2: Plan** 
"Think harder about how to add OAuth support. Create a detailed plan considering:
- Integration with existing auth flow
- Database schema changes needed
- Testing strategy
- Security considerations"

**Phase 3: Code**
"Now implement the OAuth feature according to your plan. Verify each component works as you build it."

**Phase 4: Commit**
"Run all tests, fix any issues, and commit with a descriptive message following our conventional commit format."
```

#### Why This Works
- **Prevents scope creep**: Claude stays focused
- **Improves quality**: Planning phase catches edge cases
- **Reduces iterations**: Better first attempts
- **Maintains context**: Each phase builds on the last

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Claude

TDD becomes incredibly powerful with Claude:

```markdown
**Step 1: Write Tests First**
"Write comprehensive tests for the user authentication feature. Cover:
- Valid login scenarios
- Invalid credentials
- Session management
- Edge cases like expired tokens

Be explicit that this is TDD - don't create mock implementations."

**Step 2: Verify Test Failures**
"Run the tests and confirm they fail as expected. Don't write any implementation code yet."

**Step 3: Implement to Pass Tests**
"Now write the minimum code needed to make all tests pass. Don't modify the tests."

**Step 4: Iterate Until Green**
"Keep iterating - run tests, fix issues, repeat until all tests pass."
```

### 3. Visual Development Workflow

For UI work, use Claude's visual capabilities:

```markdown
**Setup Visual Feedback**
"Set up Puppeteer MCP server so you can take screenshots of our React app."

**Implement with Visual Targets**
"Here's the design mock [drag/drop image]. Implement this component, take a screenshot of the result, and iterate until it matches the design."

**Progressive Refinement**
"The layout is close but spacing is off. Take another screenshot and adjust the CSS until the spacing matches the design exactly."
```

### 4. The "Safe YOLO" Approach

For repetitive tasks in secure environments:

```bash
# Run with specific allowed tools (safer approach)
claude --allowedTools "Edit,Bash(eslint:*)" "Fix all ESLint errors in the src/ directory"
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Use `--allowedTools` to grant specific permissions. Only use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in secure, isolated environments.

**Use Cases:**
- Fixing linter errors in sandboxed environments
- Code formatting in trusted codebases
- Updating import statements
- Generating boilerplate code

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Extended Thinking Triggers

Claude has different thinking levels you can activate:

- `"think"` - Basic extended thinking
- `"think hard"` - More computation time  
- `"think harder"` - Even more analysis
- `"ultrathink"` - Maximum thinking budget

### Subagent Orchestration

Let Claude manage specialized subagents:

```markdown
"Use subagents to investigate this performance issue:
1. Have one subagent analyze the database queries
2. Have another examine the frontend bundle size
3. Have a third review the caching strategy
Then synthesize their findings into recommendations."
```

### Context Management

#### Smart Context Clearing
- Use `/clear` between different tasks
- Use `/compact` at natural breakpoints (after completing features)
- Keep conversations focused on single objectives

#### Context Priming
Load relevant context systematically:
```markdown
"Before we start, read these files to understand the context:
- @src/auth/auth_service.py
- @tests/auth/test_auth.py  
- @docs/auth_requirements.md

Then let me know when you understand the current authentication architecture."
```

### File and Data Handling

#### Multiple Input Methods
- **Copy/paste**: Direct text input
- **Pipe data**: `cat logfile.txt | claude "analyze these error logs"`
- **File references**: Use tab-completion for accurate paths
- **URL fetching**: Paste URLs for Claude to read documentation
- **Image analysis**: Drag/drop or Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4 → Ctrl+V on macOS

---

## Team Workflows

### Shared CLAUDE.md Strategy

Create a hierarchical CLAUDE.md system:

```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md                 # Global project rules
├── frontend/CLAUDE.md        # Frontend-specific guidelines  
├── backend/CLAUDE.md         # Backend-specific patterns
└── docs/CLAUDE.md           # Documentation standards
```

### Custom Slash Commands for Teams

Create team-specific workflows in `.claude/commands/`:

#### `/project:fix-github-issue.md`
```markdown
Please analyze and fix GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS

Follow our team process:
1. Use `gh issue view` to get issue details
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b fix/issue-$ARGUMENTS`
3. Search codebase for relevant files
4. Implement fix following our coding standards
5. Write/update tests to verify the fix
6. Run full test suite and linting
7. Commit with format: `fix: resolve issue #$ARGUMENTS - [description]`
8. Push and create PR with our template
```

#### `/project:code-review.md`
```markdown
Perform comprehensive code review of recent changes:

1. **Standards Compliance**
   - Check TypeScript/React conventions
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Ensure accessibility standards

2. **Quality Assurance**  
   - Review test coverage
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Validate performance implications

3. **Documentation**
   - Confirm documentation is updated
   - Check for inline comments where needed

Use our established checklist and update CLAUDE.md with new patterns.
```

### Prompt Plans for Complex Projects

Use structured prompt planning for large features:

#### `spec.md` - High-level specification
```markdown
# Feature: Real-time Collaboration

## Requirements
- Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously
- Changes sync in real-time
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Offline support with sync on reconnect

## Technical Approach
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

- [ ] Handle reconnection scenarios

## Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization
```

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test-First Development Pattern

```markdown
"We're implementing TDD. First, write comprehensive tests for the shopping cart feature:
- Add items to cart
- Remove items from cart  
- Update quantities
- Calculate totals with tax
- Handle discount codes
- Manage cart persistence

Don't implement any actual cart logic yet - just the test cases."
```

### Automated Code Review Setup

Use GitHub Actions with Claude Code:

```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/install-github-app
```

Then customize the review prompt in `claude-code-review.yml`:
```yaml
direct_prompt: |
  Review this PR focusing on:
  - Security vulnerabilities and input validation
  - Logic errors and edge cases  
  - Performance implications
  - Code maintainability
  
  Be concise - only report significant issues, not style preferences.
```

### Quality Gates with Pre-commit Hooks

Set up comprehensive quality checks:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml  
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: tests
        name: Run test suite
        entry: npm test
        language: system
      - id: typecheck  
        name: TypeScript check
        entry: npm run typecheck
        language: system
      - id: lint
        name: ESLint check
        entry: npm run lint
        language: system
```

### Testing Strategies by Language

#### Python Projects
```markdown
"Set up pytest with these fixtures and test patterns:
- Database fixtures with rollback
- API client fixtures  
- Mock external services
- Coverage reporting with minimum 80% threshold"
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
```markdown
"Configure Jest with:
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression tests for UI components"
```

---

## Security & Production Practices

### Secure Development Workflow

#### Code Security Reviews
Create a security-focused CLAUDE.md section:
```markdown
## Security Requirements

### Input Validation
- ALWAYS validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication checks

### Sensitive Data Handling  
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper session management

### Security Testing
- Run dependency vulnerability scans
- Test for common OWASP vulnerabilities
- Validate API authentication and authorization
```

#### Security-First Prompts
```markdown
"Review this authentication endpoint as a security expert. Focus on:
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. SQL injection vulnerabilities  
3. Authentication bypass scenarios
4. Session management security
5. Rate limiting and brute force protection

Identify any security risks and provide specific fixes."
```

### Production Deployment Patterns

#### Infrastructure as Code
```markdown
"Create Terraform configuration for:
- Auto-scaling web servers
- RDS database with backups
- Redis cache cluster
- Load balancer with SSL
- CloudWatch monitoring

Follow security best practices for network isolation and access control."
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
```markdown
"Set up GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Runs security scans on dependencies
2. Executes full test suite
3. Builds production artifacts
4. Deploys to staging environment
5. Runs smoke tests
6. Promotes to production with approval gate
7. Sends Slack notifications for status updates"
```

### Handling Sensitive Code

**Never share:**
- API keys or credentials
- Customer data or PII
- Proprietary algorithms
- Security tokens

**Best practices:**
- Use private Claude instances for sensitive projects
- Implement proper access controls
- Sanitize data before sharing with Claude
- Use environment variables for configuration

---

## Cost Optimization

### Token Management Strategies

#### Efficient Context Usage
- Use `/clear` frequently to reset context
- Keep prompts focused and specific
- Avoid including unnecessary file contents
- Use file references instead of copying large files

#### Resource Management for Teams
- **Simple tasks**: Documentation, basic analysis, formatting
- **Standard development**: Feature implementation, code review, testing  
- **Complex tasks**: Architecture design, security reviews, critical debugging

#### Usage Monitoring
Monitor usage through Claude's built-in tracking and third-party tools:
```bash
# Check current session usage
/usage

# View conversation statistics
/stats
```

### Workflow Optimization

#### Batch Operations
```markdown
"Process these 15 similar API endpoints in batch:
1. Add input validation
2. Update error handling  
3. Add logging
4. Update tests
5. Generate documentation

Work through them systematically, committing after each group of 3."
```

#### Parallel Processing
Run multiple Claude instances for independent tasks:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend work
cd frontend && claude

# Terminal 2: Backend API  
cd backend && claude

# Terminal 3: Testing
cd tests && claude
```

---

## Multi-Claude Workflows

### Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel work
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b -b feature-b  
git worktree add ../project-bugfix -b bugfix

# Start Claude in each
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
# (repeat in separate terminals)
```

### Review and Implementation Pattern

**Terminal 1: Implementation**
```markdown
"Implement the new payment processing feature according to the spec in @docs/payment-spec.md"
```

**Terminal 2: Review**
```markdown
"Review the payment processing code that was just implemented. Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Error handling completeness  
- Test coverage
- Code maintainability"
```

**Terminal 3: Integration**
```markdown
"Integrate the reviewed payment code with feedback from the reviewer. Address all security concerns and add missing tests."
```

### Specialized Agent Coordination

Use different Claude instances for specialized roles:

```markdown
# Architecture Agent
"Act as a senior architect. Design the microservice structure for our e-commerce platform."

# Security Agent  
"Act as a security expert. Review the authentication system for vulnerabilities."

# Performance Agent
"Act as a performance engineer. Optimize the database queries and caching strategy."
```

4. Generate automated test report with visual validation"
```

### Custom MCP Server Development

For team-specific needs:
```javascript
// Custom MCP server for internal APIs
const server = new McpServer({
  name: 'company-internal-api',
  version: '1.0.0'
});

server.addTool({
  name: 'query_user_analytics',
  description: 'Query our internal user analytics API',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      metric: { type: 'string' },
      timeRange: { type: 'string' }
    }
  }
});
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Context Window Management
**Problem**: Claude loses track in long conversations
**Solution**: 
```markdown
"Before continuing, create a summary of our current progress and save it to progress.md. Then use /compact to optimize context."
```

#### Permission Errors
**Problem**: Constant permission prompts
**Solution**:
```bash
# Add commonly used tools to allowlist
/permissions add Edit
/permissions add "Bash(git:*)"
/permissions add "Bash(npm:*)"
```

#### Code Quality Issues
**Problem**: Claude generates working but low-quality code
**Solution**: Improve CLAUDE.md with specific examples:
```markdown
## Code Quality Standards

❌ Bad: Direct database queries in controllers
```python
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", user_id)
```

✅ Good: Use repository pattern
```python
def get_user(user_id):
    return UserRepository.find_by_id(user_id)
```
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Faster Feedback Loops
- Use subagents for parallel investigation
- Batch similar operations together  
- Keep conversations focused on single objectives
- Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks

#### Effective Prompting
```markdown
# Instead of vague requests
"Make the code better"

# Be specific about improvements  
"Refactor the authentication middleware to:
1. Extract validation logic into separate functions
2. Add proper error handling with specific error messages
3. Improve type safety with TypeScript
4. Add unit tests covering edge cases"
```

### Debugging Strategies

#### Stack Trace Analysis
```markdown
"Analyze this stack trace and production logs. Trace the control flow through our codebase and identify:
1. Root cause of the error
2. Contributing factors  
3. Specific fix needed
4. Prevention strategies for similar issues"
```

#### Performance Investigation  
```markdown
"Use subagents to investigate this performance issue:
1. Database Agent: Analyze slow queries and indexing
2. Frontend Agent: Check bundle size and render performance  
3. Network Agent: Review API response times and caching
Synthesize findings with specific optimization recommendations."
```
