The best engineering managers don't pride themselves on being heroic problem-solvers. They build systems that prevent problems from becoming emergencies in the first place.

## The Trap of Being Indispensable

Early in your EM career, solving urgent problems feels rewarding. You swoop in, unblock the team, and everyone breathes easier. But this pattern creates a dangerous dependency: your team learns to escalate to you instead of developing judgment about what truly needs escalation.

**The transformation**: Shift from being the go-to problem solver to being the architect of escalation paths.

## What an Escalation Path Actually Is

An escalation path isn't a flowchart on a wiki page. It's a living system that answers three questions:

1. **What decisions can be made at each level?** Define clear authority boundaries. Junior engineers can choose implementation details. Senior engineers can choose technical approaches. Staff+ engineers can choose architectural patterns. You choose strategic technical bets.

2. **What context is needed to make good decisions?** Document not just the "what" but the "why" behind past decisions. Create decision logs, ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and strategy docs that equip your team to think like you would.

3. **When should something truly escalate?** Define bright lines: customer-facing outages, security vulnerabilities, cross-team dependencies, or decisions that can't be easily reversed. Everything else stays at the lowest competent level.

## The Implementation

Start this week:

**Identify your last 10 interruptions.** Which ones could have been handled without you if the team had the right context or decision-making authority?

**Write one decision-making guide.** Pick your most common type of escalation. Document: the decision framework, examples of good calls, when to escalate vs. decide independently, and who owns what.

**Actively push decisions down.** Next time someone asks for your call, ask: "What would you decide if I weren't available?" Then coach their thinking rather than giving answers. Over time, you'll train judgment, not dependency.

**Create feedback loops.** Review decisions made without you weekly. Celebrate good calls publicly. Discuss near-misses constructively. This builds organizational muscle memory.

## The Leverage

When you build escalation paths instead of becoming the escalation point, you unlock geometric growth:

- Your team makes faster decisions (no bottleneck on you)
- You free up cognitive space for actual strategy
- Your engineers develop senior-level judgment faster
- The organization scales beyond your individual capacity
- You become promotable because the team thrives without your constant involvement

The marker of great engineering leadership isn't how many fires you put out—it's how few fires reach you in the first place.

Start building the paths today. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.
