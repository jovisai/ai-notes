The best engineering managers understand a powerful truth: **the story you tell about your team's work often matters more than the work itself**.

This isn't about spin or manipulation. It's about recognizing that in complex organizations, reality is constructed through shared narratives. If you don't actively shape the story, someone else will—and they might not understand the full context.

## Why This Matters at Scale

As you scale beyond a single team, your impact becomes increasingly mediated through perception. Executives don't see the elegant architecture your team built. Product partners don't sit in your sprint planning. Cross-functional stakeholders don't understand the technical debt you're managing.

What they see is the narrative: Are you reactive or strategic? Are you a cost center or a value driver? Are you blocking progress or enabling it?

## The Three Narratives Every EM Must Own

### 1. The Forward Narrative (Vision)
Where is your team going? What future are you building toward?

**Bad:** "We're working on improving the API layer."
**Good:** "We're building the platform foundation that will let us ship features 3x faster next quarter and enable our expansion into new markets."

### 2. The Present Narrative (Progress)
What are you accomplishing right now? How does it connect to the bigger picture?

**Bad:** Weekly status updates listing completed tickets.
**Good:** Quarterly updates showing how your architectural investments reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 10 minutes, unblocking the mobile team's release cadence.

### 3. The Backward Narrative (Learning)
When things go wrong (and they will), how do you frame it?

**Bad:** "The migration took longer than expected."
**Good:** "The migration revealed critical gaps in our testing infrastructure. We've invested in automated rollback mechanisms that prevented two potential outages this quarter and will save us weeks on future migrations."

## How to Start Today

1. **Write it down.** Create a living document that articulates your team's strategy, current priorities, and recent wins. Update it monthly. Share it widely.

2. **Connect dots explicitly.** Never present work without connecting it to business outcomes. "We improved API latency" means nothing. "We reduced API latency by 40%, which directly enabled the checkout team to hit their conversion goals" creates understanding.

3. **Pre-empt the alternative narrative.** Before your quarterly planning meeting, ask: "What story will executives tell themselves if I don't provide one?" Then proactively address it.

4. **Make allies the storytellers.** The most powerful narratives come from others. Help your product partners, peer EMs, and executives understand your work well enough that they tell your story for you.

## The Meta-Skill

Writing the narrative isn't just about communication—it's about thinking clearly. When you can't articulate a compelling story about your team's work, it's often because the strategy itself is unclear.

The act of crafting the narrative forces strategic clarity. It makes you answer: Why this? Why now? What's the impact?

**Great engineering managers don't just build great teams. They make sure everyone knows they're building great teams—and why it matters.**

Start writing your narrative today. Your future impact depends on it.
