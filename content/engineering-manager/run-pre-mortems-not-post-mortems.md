title: Run Pre-Mortems, Not Post-Mortems

Most engineering teams are great at post-mortems—dissecting what went wrong after a failure. But elite teams do something counterintuitive: they run pre-mortems before launching critical projects.

## What Is a Pre-Mortem?

A pre-mortem is a practice where you gather your team at the start of a project and ask: "It's six months from now. This project has failed spectacularly. What went wrong?"

This simple inversion unlocks brutal honesty that typical planning meetings never surface.

## Why Pre-Mortems Work

When you ask "what could go wrong?", people hedge. They don't want to seem negative or risk-averse. But when you assume failure has already happened, psychological safety increases. Team members feel permission to voice concerns they'd otherwise suppress.

Research from Gary Klein shows pre-mortems help teams identify 30% more potential problems than traditional planning approaches.

## How to Run One

1. **Set the stage**: "It's [future date]. Our [project] has failed. We missed the deadline, had quality issues, and the business is unhappy."

2. **Individual brainstorming** (5 min): Everyone writes down reasons for the failure. No discussion yet.

3. **Round-robin sharing**: Each person shares their top failure mode. Write everything on a board.

4. **Cluster and prioritize**: Group similar risks. Vote on the most likely and most damaging.

5. **Create mitigations**: For the top 3-5 risks, define concrete actions to prevent or detect them early.

## What You'll Discover

Pre-mortems surface the undiscussable:
- "We don't actually have buy-in from the data team we depend on"
- "Our architecture can't handle the expected scale"
- "We've never successfully integrated with this vendor's API"
- "The PM and engineer have different understandings of 'done'"

These aren't technical problems. They're organizational and communication problems that would derail your project—but only a pre-mortem makes them safe to name.

## The Strategic Impact

As an engineering manager, pre-mortems give you three forms of leverage:

**1. Risk mitigation**: You fix problems before they become crises.

**2. Team alignment**: Hidden assumptions become explicit. Everyone leaves with the same mental model.

**3. Psychological safety**: You normalize speaking up about concerns, which compounds over time.

## Start This Week

For your next significant project or initiative:
- Schedule a 45-minute pre-mortem before kickoff
- Ask the failure question
- Listen more than you speak
- Turn concerns into concrete mitigations

The best engineering leaders don't just recover from failure well—they prevent it proactively. Pre-mortems are how you do that at scale.
