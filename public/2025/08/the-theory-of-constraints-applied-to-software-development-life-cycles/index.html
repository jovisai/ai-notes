    <p>As engineering leaders, we often focus on optimizing individual processes—faster CI/CD, better code reviews, more efficient testing. But what if the real performance gains come from identifying the single constraint that&rsquo;s limiting your entire delivery pipeline?</p>
<p>The Theory of Constraints teaches us that every system has exactly one bottleneck that determines overall throughput. In software development, this could be:</p>
<p><strong>Common SDLC Bottlenecks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code review queues that delay merges for days</li>
<li>Manual testing phases that create deployment delays</li>
<li>Infrastructure provisioning that blocks feature rollouts</li>
<li>Knowledge silos where only one person can deploy certain services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Five-Step Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify</strong> the constraint (often where work piles up)</li>
<li><strong>Exploit</strong> it (maximize efficiency of the bottleneck)</li>
<li><strong>Subordinate</strong> everything else to support the constraint</li>
<li><strong>Elevate</strong> the constraint (add resources or automate)</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong> when the constraint shifts elsewhere</li>
</ol>
<p>Real example: A team discovered their deployment process was the constraint, taking 3 hours per release. Instead of optimizing development speed, they focused on automating deployments. Result: 40% faster overall delivery without touching a single line of application code.</p>
<p>The key insight? Optimizing non-constraints often creates more work-in-progress without improving delivery speed. Find your constraint first.</p>
