    <p><em>Why mastering &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; matters more than ever in the age of AI</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-three-layers-of-every-job">The Three Layers of Every Job</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a framework I&rsquo;ve been thinking about: every job, every role, every task you do breaks down into three fundamental layers.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/three_layers.png" alt="The Three Layers of Every Job">

</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>
The purpose. The demand. The reason something needs to exist.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>
The decision. The direction. Choosing what to build, what to solve, what to prioritize.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>
The execution. The method. The implementation details.</p>
<p>These layers aren&rsquo;t new. They&rsquo;ve always existed. But AI is fundamentally reshaping how value is distributed across them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ai-is-rapidly-solving-the-how">AI Is Rapidly Solving the &ldquo;How&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about what&rsquo;s happening: AI is getting exceptionally good at the &ldquo;how&rdquo; layer.</p>
<p>Write code? AI can do it. Generate a marketing email? Done. Create a design mockup? Handled. Summarize a document, analyze data, build a prototype,  all increasingly within AI&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t speculation. It&rsquo;s already here. Teams are shipping AI-generated code at scale. Content is being produced faster than ever. The execution layer is being automated.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what most people miss about this shift.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-what-is-hard-for-ai">The &ldquo;What&rdquo; Is Hard for AI</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;what&rdquo; layer is deciding what to build, what problem to solve, what direction to take, remains stubbornly difficult for AI.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because &ldquo;what&rdquo; decisions often involve something that has <strong>never been done before</strong>. They require judgment calls in ambiguous situations. They demand understanding of context that doesn&rsquo;t exist in any training dataset.</p>
<p>Think about it: the &ldquo;how&rdquo; has been done a million times. There are patterns, best practices, documented solutions. That&rsquo;s exactly what makes it trainable.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;what&rdquo; is the opposite. It&rsquo;s novel. It&rsquo;s contextual. It&rsquo;s the space where you&rsquo;re making decisions without a playbook.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/ai_capability.png" alt="Where AI Excels vs. Where Humans Lead">

</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-why-is-the-moat">The &ldquo;Why&rdquo; Is the Moat</h2>
<p>If &ldquo;what&rdquo; is hard for AI, &ldquo;why&rdquo; is nearly untouchable.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;why&rdquo; is what makes people care before a product even exists. It&rsquo;s conviction. It&rsquo;s meaning. It&rsquo;s the foundation of every brand, every movement, every product that ever mattered.</p>
<p>AI can help you build faster. It can optimize, iterate, and execute at scale.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t wake up one day and decide something needs to exist. It can&rsquo;t tell you what&rsquo;s worth building. It can&rsquo;t create demand from nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a human act.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="this-isnt-new-its-just-the-next-abstraction-layer">This Isn&rsquo;t New, It&rsquo;s Just the Next Abstraction Layer</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this pattern before.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/abstraction_evolution.png" alt="Each Layer Commoditizes the One Below">

</p>
<p>When calculators arrived, you stopped needing to know <em>how</em> to multiply. You only needed to know <em>why</em> and <em>what</em> to calculate.</p>
<p>When spreadsheets emerged, manual calculation became obsolete. The value shifted to knowing what questions to ask of the data.</p>
<p>When SQL made data retrieval accessible, the competitive advantage moved to understanding what insights mattered.</p>
<p>AI is doing the same thing abstracting away the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and pushing value upward to &ldquo;why&rdquo; and &ldquo;what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people who thrived at each transition were the ones who moved up the stack quickly. The pattern hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-software-engineers">What This Means for Software Engineers</h2>
<p>Software engineering has always been heavy on the &ldquo;how&rdquo; side.</p>
<p>Write the code. Implement the solution. Ship the feature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the part getting commoditized fastest.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/engineer_shift.png" alt="The Engineer&rsquo;s Career Shift">

</p>
<p>The engineers who will thrive aren&rsquo;t the ones with the most elegant implementations. They&rsquo;re the ones who can look at a problem and say:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t build this at all.&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;The real problem is upstream.&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what actually matters.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s a &ldquo;what&rdquo; skill. And critically, it&rsquo;s learnable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-uncomfortable-truth">The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>
<p>Most software engineering training, hiring, and career ladders are still optimized for &ldquo;how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We interview for algorithms. We promote for shipping. We reward lines of code and features delivered.</p>
<p>The incentive structures haven&rsquo;t caught up to the reality.</p>
<p>The engineers who recognize this shift early and deliberately cultivate &ldquo;what&rdquo; skills =will have a significant advantage. Not because &ldquo;how&rdquo; skills become worthless, but because they become table stakes. The baseline. The commodity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="where-to-position-yourself">Where to Position Yourself</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/value_stack.png" alt="The Value Stack">

</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the prediction for 2026:</p>
<p>The most valuable skill won&rsquo;t be prompting AI. It won&rsquo;t even be building AI systems.</p>
<p>It will be mastering the &ldquo;why&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rdquo;, the layers that remain distinctly human.</p>
<p><strong>Until AI can solve the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; humans are safe.</strong></p>
<p>But if your job is mostly about &ldquo;how,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d move up the stack.</p>
<p>Fast.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-develop-what-skills">How to Develop &ldquo;What&rdquo; Skills</h2>
<p>Moving from &ldquo;how&rdquo; to &ldquo;what&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about abandoning technical depth. It&rsquo;s about expanding your perspective. Some practical approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask &ldquo;should we?&rdquo; before &ldquo;how do we?&rdquo;</strong>
Train yourself to question whether a solution is worth building before diving into implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the business context</strong>
Know why your work matters to customers, to revenue, to the company&rsquo;s strategy. The &ldquo;what&rdquo; becomes clearer when you understand the &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice saying no</strong>
The ability to kill bad ideas early is a &ldquo;what&rdquo; skill. It requires confidence and judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace ambiguity</strong>
&ldquo;What&rdquo; decisions rarely have clear right answers. Get comfortable making calls with incomplete information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spend time with customers</strong>
Understanding real problems, not just technical specifications, shifts your thinking from execution to direction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h2>
<p>The big picture here isn&rsquo;t that different from the past. Technology has always added abstraction layers on top of jobs.</p>
<p>AI is just adding the next one.</p>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether this shift is coming. It&rsquo;s whether you&rsquo;ll be ready for it.</p>
