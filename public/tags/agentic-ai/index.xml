      <title>TDD with Coding Agents: Building a Rate Limiting Service</title>

      <description>Problem Overview We&amp;rsquo;ll build a sophisticated rate limiting service that supports:&#xA;Multiple rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket, Fixed Window, Sliding Window) Different storage backends (Memory, Redis) Per-user and per-API-key limits Rate limit headers in responses Graceful degradation when storage fails This is complex enough to demonstrate TDD&amp;rsquo;s power with AI agents.&#xA;Why TDD Works Exceptionally Well with AI Agents The AI Agent Advantage:&#xA;Perfect Memory: Never forgets edge cases once written in tests Pattern Recognition: Excellent at implementing algorithms to match test specifications Systematic Approach: Follows TDD discipline consistently Rapid Iteration: Fast feedback cycles between test and implementation The Key Insight: AI agents excel when they have clear specifications (tests) rather than vague requirements.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mixture of Experts (MoE) from First Principles</title>

      <description>One of the most exciting architectural innovations in recent years is the Mixture of Experts (MoE). It&amp;rsquo;s a key reason why models like Mistral&amp;rsquo;s Mixtral and (reportedly) OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-4 are so powerful.&#xA;To really understand MoE, let’s go back to first principles. Here’s a rewritten version of your article with a Flesch Reading Ease score above 70. The language is simpler and more direct, while keeping the core ideas intact.</description>

      <title>My Thoughts on Andrew Ng&#39;s &#34;Building Faster and Smarter with AI&#34;</title>

      <description>I watched Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s latest talk on AI startup strategy, and while I disagree with some of the hype, there are genuinely useful insights buried in the promotional language. Here&amp;rsquo;s what caught my attention. Ng isn&amp;rsquo;t chasing the latest transformer variant or arguing about AGI timelines. He&amp;rsquo;s focused on something much more important: how AI actually helps people build useful things faster.&#xA;Applications Win, Infrastructure Follows The media loves talking about chips and foundation models.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Communication Protocols MCP, ACP, A2A, and ANP</title>

      <description>As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, we are moving from single AI models to complex systems of multiple AI agents working together. These multi-agent systems (MAS) have the potential to solve incredibly complex problems, but they face a fundamental challenge: how do the agents talk to each other?&#xA;Just like humans need language to cooperate, AI agents need communication protocols. These protocols are the rules of the road for AI interaction, defining how agents can exchange information, request actions, and work together on tasks.</description>

      <title>Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI</title>

      <description>I recently came across a paper titled &amp;ldquo;Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI,&amp;rdquo; and it got me thinking. The message is simple but powerful: bigger isn&amp;rsquo;t always better.&#xA;In the current AI landscape, we often assume that more power equals more performance. But this paper challenges that assumption. Instead, it offers a smarter and more strategic view of how AI can scale without scaling costs.&#xA;Let’s break it down.</description>
